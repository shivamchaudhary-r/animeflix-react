Animeflix is an web application parodying the Netflix frontend, but with animes only, solely made to practice how to build a responsive layout with HTML, css and JavaScript in React as well as how to read data from a third party API. It works like a catalogue, consuming real anime data from the [Kitsu API](https://kitsu.docs.apiary.io/), allowing users to search through Kitsu catalogue, list various animes, read a brief description about each of them, list all episodes registered in the API and watch trailers.
